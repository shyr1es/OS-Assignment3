3.4 Some computer systems provide multiple register sets. 
Describe what happens when a context switch occurs if the new context is already loaded 
into one of the register sets. What happens if the new context is in memory rather than in a register 
set and all the register sets are in use?

If the new context is in a register set: The processor directly 
switches to the appropriate set of registers, enabling a faster context switch.

If the new context is in memory and all register sets are occupied: 
The operating system saves one of the current register sets to memory, 
freeing it up to load the new context. 
This process adds more overhead due to the extra memory operations.
