3.17 What are the benefits and disadvantages of each of the following? 
Consider both the system level and the programmer level.

a. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication:

Synchronous: Immediate feedback but can cause delays.

Asynchronous: Allows processes to proceed independently but requires additional tracking.

b. Automatic vs. Explicit Buffering:

Automatic: Easier to implement but less control.

Explicit: More control but increased complexity.

c. Send by Copy vs. Send by Reference:

Copy: Avoids shared-state issues but uses more memory.

Reference: Saves memory but risks unintended modifications.

d. Fixed-Sized vs. Variable-Sized Messages:

Fixed-Sized: Predictable but may waste space.

Variable-Sized: Flexible but harder to manage.
