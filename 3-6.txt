3.6 Consider the “exactly once” semantic with respect to the RPC mechanism. 
Does the algorithm for implementing this semantic execute correctly even if the ACK message sent back 
to the client is lost due to a network problem? 
Describe the sequence of messages and discuss whether “exactly once” is still preserved.

If the ACK (acknowledgment) message is lost, the client may resend the RPC request. To maintain the "exactly once" guarantee, 
the server must identify duplicate requests using a unique identifier for each RPC call. 
By discarding repeated requests and avoiding re-execution, the semantic is preserved.

Sequence:

Client sends an RPC request to the server.

The server processes the request and sends back an ACK.

If the ACK is lost, the client retries the request.

The server checks the unique ID of the retried request, recognizes it as a duplicate, and does not reprocess it.

Conclusion: The operation still executes exactly once, even with lost ACK messages.
