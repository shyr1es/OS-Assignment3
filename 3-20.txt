3.20 Implement a PID manager responsible for managing process identifiers.

The PID manager ensures that process IDs (PIDs) are unique and reusable after a process terminates. 
Use the following constants:
#define MIN_PID 300
#define MAX_PID 5000

Steps:

Use a bitmap to track PID availability (0 = available, 1 = in use).

Implement these functions:

int allocate_map(void): Initializes the PID map.

int allocate_pid(void): Allocates a PID or returns -1 if none are available.

void release_pid(int pid): Marks a PID as available for reuse.
