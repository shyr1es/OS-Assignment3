3.15 Consider the RPC mechanism. Describe the undesirable consequences that could arise 
from not enforcing either the “at most once” or 
“exactly once” semantic. Describe possible uses for a mechanism that has neither of these guarantees.

Issues Without “At Most Once”: Duplicate operations can lead to inconsistent states.

Issues Without “Exactly Once”: Lost operations can result in incomplete tasks.

Possible Use Cases: A mechanism without strict 
guarantees might be suitable for non-critical tasks like periodic logging or telemetry,
 where occasional data loss or duplication is acceptable.
