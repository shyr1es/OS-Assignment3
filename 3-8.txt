3.8 Describe the actions taken by a kernel to context-switch between processes.

Save the current processâ€™s execution state (e.g., registers, program counter) in its Process Control Block (PCB).

Change the state of the current process to "waiting" or "ready" as appropriate.

Use a scheduling algorithm to select the next process to execute.

Load the saved state of the selected process from its PCB into the CPU.

Update the memory management unit (if needed) to reflect the new process's address space.

Resume execution of the new process from its last saved point.
