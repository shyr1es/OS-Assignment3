3.9 Construct a process tree similar to Figure 3.7.

To create a process tree in UNIX/Linux:

Use the command ps -ael to list processes.

Refer to the PPID column (Parent Process ID) to identify parent-child relationships.

Use a tool like pstree or manually map processes by starting with the root process (e.g., init or systemd).
