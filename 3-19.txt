3.19 Write a C program called time.c that determines the amount of time necessary to run a command from the command line.

This program will:

Use fork() to create a child process.

Record the current timestamp before executing the command (gettimeofday() for timing).

Execute the command in the child process (exec() family functions).

Measure the time elapsed once the child process completes (parent process handles this).

Shared Memory Implementation:

The child writes the starting time into shared memory before running the command.

The parent reads the starting time from shared memory after the child exits and calculates the elapsed time.

Pipe Implementation:

The child sends the starting time through a pipe to the parent before running the command.

The parent retrieves this time from the pipe after the child process finishes and computes the elapsed duration.
