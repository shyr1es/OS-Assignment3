3.7 Assume that a distributed system is susceptible to server failure. 
What mechanisms would be required to guarantee the “exactly once” semantic for execution of RPCs?

Unique Identifiers for Requests: Ensures that the server can detect and handle duplicate requests correctly.

Persistent Logs: The server keeps a record of completed operations, enabling recovery after a failure.

Reliable Communication Channels: 
Mechanisms like retransmissions ensure that messages (including acknowledgments) are delivered.

Idempotent Design: Operations should be crafted so that re-execution does not cause unwanted effects.
