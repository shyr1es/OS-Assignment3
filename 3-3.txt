Original versions of Appleâ€™s mobile iOS operating system provided no means of concurrent processing. 
Discuss three major complications that concurrent processing adds to an operating system.

Data Races: Multiple processes or threads trying to access shared resources 
at the same time can result in unpredictable outcomes.

Deadlocks: A situation where two or 
more processes are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, leading to a system freeze.

Overhead of Synchronization: Managing coordination between processes requires additional 
resources like locks or semaphores, increasing  system complexity.
