3.10 Explain the role of the init (or systemd) process on UNIX and Linux systems in regard to process termination.

The init/systemd process acts as the parent for orphaned processes, ensuring they terminate correctly.

It cleans up resources allocated to child processes and removes their entries from the process table.

This prevents zombie processes from accumulating in the system.
