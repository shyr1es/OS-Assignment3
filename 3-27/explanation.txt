Solution for Question 3.27:
Design a File-Copying Program Using Ordinary Pipes:

This program copies the content of one file to another using a parent-child process with a pipe for data transfer. 
The parent process reads the source file and writes to the pipe, 
while the child process reads from the pipe and writes to the destination file.

Explanation:
Arguments:

The program takes two arguments:
Source file (argv[1])
Destination file (argv[2]).
Parent Process:

Reads the source file and writes its content to the pipe.
Child Process:

Reads from the pipe and writes the data to the destination file.
Key Functions:

pipe(): Creates a pipe for communication.
fork(): Splits the process into parent and child.
open(): Opens files for reading/writing.
read() and write(): Handles file and pipe I/O.
Error Handling:

Checks for file open, read, and write errors.
Handles pipe creation and process forking errors.
